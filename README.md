# My Shit in Labs & Assignments Archive

This repository is an archive of coursework, labs, and small projects from ZC 3rd semester.

Contents are grouped by course code and contain lab files, sample code, and notes used during the semester.

## Structure

- `CSAI301/` — AI labs and notebooks.
- `SW-301/` — Java labs and example projects (source under `src/`).
- `SW-302/` — UI labs (HTML/CSS samples).

## Quick start

Open the folders for the lab or course you want to explore. Notebooks (`.ipynb`) can be opened with VS Code or Jupyter. Java sources are under `SW-301/src/` and can be built with a Java toolchain (javac/IDE).

## Contributing
